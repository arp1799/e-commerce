<p xss="removed"><span xss="removed">4.               </span>The Data Protection Principles</p>
<p xss="removed">This Policy aims to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Law. The GDPR sets out the following principles with which any party handling personal data must comply. Data controllers are responsible for and must be able to demonstrate such compliance. All personal data must be:</p>
<p xss="removed">4.1            processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;</p>
<p xss="removed">4.2            collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;</p>
<p xss="removed">4.3            adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed;</p>
<p xss="removed">4.4            accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which it is processed, is erased, or rectified without delay;</p>
<p xss="removed">4.5            kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed. Personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, subject to the implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject;</p>
<p xss="removed">4.6            processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.</p>
<p xss="removed"> </p>
<p xss="removed"><span xss="removed">5.               </span>The Rights of Data Subjects</p>
<p xss="removed">The GDPR sets out the following key rights applicable to data subjects:</p>
<p xss="removed">5.1            The right to be informed;</p>
<p xss="removed">5.2            the right of access;</p>
<p xss="removed">5.3            the right to rectification;</p>
<p xss="removed">5.4            the right to erasure (also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’);</p>
<p xss="removed">5.5            the right to restrict processing;</p>
<p xss="removed">5.6            the right to data portability;</p>
<p xss="removed">5.7            the right to object; and</p>
<p xss="removed">5.8            rights with respect to automated decision-making and profiling.</p>
<p xss="removed"> </p>
<p xss="removed"><span xss="removed">6.               </span>Lawful, Fair, and Transparent Data Processing</p>
<p xss="removed">6.1            Data Protection Law seeks to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, without adversely affecting the rights of the data subject. Specifically, the GDPR states that processing of personal data shall be lawful if at least one of the following applies:</p>
<p xss="removed">a)               the data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;</p>
<p xss="removed">b)               the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;</p>
<p xss="removed">c)               the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject;</p>
<p xss="removed">d)               the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;</p>
<p xss="removed">e)               the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller; or</p>
<p xss="removed">f)                the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.</p>
<p xss="removed">6.2            If the personal data in question is special category personal data (also known as “sensitive personal data”), at least one of the following conditions must be met:</p>
<p xss="removed">a)               the data subject has given their explicit consent to the processing of such data for one or more specified purposes (unless EU or EU Member State law prohibits them from doing so);</p>
<p xss="removed">b)               the processing is necessary for the purpose of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the data controller or of the data subject in the field of employment, social security, and social protection law (insofar as it is authorised by EU or EU Member State law or a collective agreement pursuant to EU Member State law which provides for appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject);</p>
<p xss="removed">c)               the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;</p>
<p xss="removed">d)               the data controller is a foundation, association, or other non-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious, or trade union aim, and the processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities, provided that the processing relates solely to the members or former members of that body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data is not disclosed outside the body without the consent of the data subjects;</p>
<p xss="removed">e)               the processing relates to personal data which is manifestly made public by the data subject;</p>
<p xss="removed">f)                the processing is necessary for the conduct of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity;</p>
<p xss="removed">g)               the processing is necessary for substantial public interest reasons, on the basis of EU or EU Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, shall respect the essence of the right to data protection, and shall provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject;</p>
<p xss="removed">h)               the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of an employee, for medical diagnosis, for the provision of health or social care or treatment, or the management of health or social care systems or services on the basis of EU or EU Member State law or pursuant to a contract with a health professional, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 9(3) of the GDPR;</p>
<p xss="removed">i)                 the processing is necessary for public interest reasons in the area of public health, for example, protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of EU or EU Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (in particular, professional secrecy); or</p>
<p xss="removed">j)                 the processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) of the GDPR based on EU or EU Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection, and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.<strong>]</strong></p>
<p xss="removed"> </p>
<p xss="removed"><span xss="removed">7.               </span>Consent</p>
<p xss="removed">If consent is relied upon as the lawful basis for collecting, holding, and/or processing personal data, the following shall apply:</p>
<p xss="removed">7.1            Consent is a clear indication by the data subject that they agree to the processing of their personal data. Such a clear indication may take the form of a statement or a positive action. Silence, pre-ticked boxes, or inactivity are unlikely to amount to consent.</p>
<p xss="removed">7.2            Where consent is given in a document which includes other matters, the section dealing with consent must be kept clearly separate from such other matters.</p>
<p xss="removed">7.3            Data subjects are free to withdraw consent at any time and it must be made easy for them to do so. If a data subject withdraws consent, their request must be honoured promptly.</p>
<p xss="removed">7.4            If personal data is to be processed for a different purpose that is incompatible with the purpose or purposes for which that personal data was originally collected that was not disclosed to the data subject when they first provided their consent, consent to the new purpose or purposes may need to be obtained from the data subject.</p>
<p xss="removed">7.5            If special category personal data is processed, the Company shall normally rely on a lawful basis other than explicit consent. If explicit consent is relied upon, the data subject in question must be issued with a suitable privacy notice in order to capture their consent.</p>
<p xss="removed">7.6            In all cases where consent is relied upon as the lawful basis for collecting, holding, and/or processing personal data, records must be kept of all consents obtained in order to ensure that the Company can demonstrate its compliance with consent requirements.</p>
